* Kimia Path24

/Kimia Path24/ is dataset for image classification and retrieval in digital
pathology. It contains 24 whole scan images (WSIs) of different tissue textures.
Dataset contains 1,325 test patches of size 1000 x 1000 (0.5mm Ã— 0.5mm)
extracted from one of the 24 WSIs. Patches for training algorithms can be
generated according to preferences of the algorithm designer using provided WSIs
(test patches are whitened). Approximately 27,000 to over 50,000 training
patches (1000 x 1000) can be extracted if the preset parameters are adopted.

** Dataset file

Entire dataset is provided in a single HDF5 file =Kimia_Path24.h5=. 

| File Name | Kimia_Path24.h5                  |
| File Size | 29409M                           |

** Dataset organization

Data is organized in a hierarchy as follows.

Scans are labeled from 0 -- 23 and they can be accessed via =\scan{id}\data=.
For convenience purposes thumbnail of each scan is provided accessed via
=\scan{id}\thumbnail=, however no scaling standard is used for thumbnail and it
must not be used for interpolating back to original scan data. Test data
contains 1325 patches from one of the 24 scans accessed via =\test_data\patches=
and its corresponding targets =\test_data\targets= for evaluation purposes.
Location from where test patches are extracted are whitened in the original
WSIs, therefore such patches must be identified during extraction training
patches.


** Reading data examples in Python and MATLAB

*** Reading data of scan with label 1

Python (h5py required):

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import h5py as h5
  data = h5.File('Kimia_Path24.h5', 'r')
  I = data['/scan1/data']
#+END_SRC

MATLAB:

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
  I=h5read('Kimia_Path24.h5', '/scan1/data');
  I=I'; %The images must be transposed to be same as images in Phyton.
#+END_SRC

*** Iterating over patches of scan with label 1

Python (h5py required):

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # This is simple code snippet showing how to read patches without any overlap.
  # Algorithm designer may want to read patches with overlap and also be able to
  # ignore less interesting patches (not containing useless information).


  import h5py as h5
  data = h5.File('Kimia_Path24.h5', 'r')
  scan1_data = data['/scan1/data']

  x_max, y_max = scan1_data.shape

  # creating patches of size (1000, 1000)
  patch_size = 1000

  x_max_iter = int(x_max/patch_size) - 1
  y_max_iter = int(y_max/patch_size) - 1

  for x in range(x_max_iter):
      for y in range(y_max_iter):
          x_loc = x*patch_size
          y_loc = y*patch_size

          # read the patch
          patch = scan1_data[x_loc:x_loc+patch_size, y_loc:y_loc+patch_size]

*** Reading test data and generating CSV file for predictions

There are 1325 test patches each of size (1000, 1000). Classification algorithm
will predict their label from 0 -- 23. For evaluation, create the CSV file
containing prediction labels for all 1325 patches in exact same order as given
in H%PY file.

Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import h5py as h5

  data = h5.File('Kimia_Path24.py', 'r')
  test_patches = data['/test_data/patches']

  predictions = map(lambda test_patch: predict(test_patch), test_patches)

  # write predictions to csv file for evaluation purpose
#+END_SRC


** Evaluation

Evaluation script is provided in both MATLAB and Python.

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, $\backslash$textbf\{Kimia Path24\}, for image classification and retrieval in digital pathology. We use the whole scan images of 24 different tissue textures to generate 1,325 test patches of size 1000\$$\backslash$times\$1000 (0.5mm\$$\backslash$times\$0.5mm). Training data can be generated according to preferences of algorithm designer and can range from approximately 27,000 to over 50,000 patches if the preset parameters are adopted. We propose a compound patch-and-scan accuracy measurement that makes achieving high accuracies quite challenging. In addition, we set the benchmarking line by applying LBP, dictionary approach and convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and report their results. The highest accuracy was 41.80$\backslash$\% for CNN.},
